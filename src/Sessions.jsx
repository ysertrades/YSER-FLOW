 * Sessions — the trading day as a 24-hour dial.
 *
 * Why a ring and not a bar: a day laid flat across a phone gives roughly 16px
 * an hour, and every window collapses into a sliver you cannot label. On a ring
 * each window gets a real arc, and "how long until the next one" becomes a
 * distance you can see rather than a number you have to read. Midnight at the
 * top, noon at the bottom, clockwise.
 *
 * Two rings, because the silver bullet sits ENTIRELY INSIDE the NY killzone.
 * On one ring the shorter arc would simply be painted over the longer one.
 * Outer is the sessions, inner is the window within a session.
 *
 * The colour is deliberately not a per-session palette. Arcs are neutral;
 * green means open right now and blue means up next — exactly the two meanings
 * those colours already carry in the calculator, so nothing has to be relearned
 * moving between tabs.

 * Every arc is a GROUP, even when it is a single stroke. The group is what
 * animates: it carries --arc-len (which every circle inside reads for its dash
 * length), the stagger index, the draw-on and the breath. One animation drives
 * the whole arc however many strokes it is made of.
 *

 * the draw-on, the sweep, the beat and the breath, all of which change
 * something underneath it. Two wider strokes at low alpha stand in for the
 * blur's falloff and cost what any other stroke costs.
 *
 * Two, not one: a single wide stroke has a hard edge where a blur has a
 * gradient, and at these alphas you can see it. The second layer was measured
 * at 6x CPU throttle and came out inside the run-to-run noise, so the softer
