     tab is opened meant the first switch paid to parse the whole document — the
     guide is 92KB and blocked the main thread for ~500ms, which is most of what
     the switch felt like.
 
     But "quiet" has to mean quiet. This used to arm a requestIdleCallback
     immediately, which meant the browser was free to spend its first idle
     moment parsing two vendored documents — and the app's first idle moment is
     exactly when the intro clears and the landing tab plays its entrance.
     Measured on a cold launch at 6x CPU throttle, that landed as sporadic
     175-215ms main-thread blocks, and the dial's sweep stopped dead in the
     middle of them. Which is what "it gets stuck and then jumps" is.
 
     So: nothing until the intro has gone, and then nothing until the entrance
     has finished. Someone who switches tabs inside that first second and a half
     pays the parse cost at the switch instead, which is the older behaviour and
     the better trade. */
